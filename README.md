# Anarchive

An infinite “crazy wall” archive built with Vite + React. This repository currently contains only the initial scaffold so the site can be grown incrementally.

## Next steps

- Add React Flow integration for the infinite canvas.
- Define data schemas for artifacts and boards.
- Implement data loaders and UI components.
